What is the goal?

- Make an HTTP server

What does an HTTP server do?

- Listens on a port for a request
  - These requests are sent via a transport layer protocol (ex: TCP)
- Processes those request (like asking for a specific webpage or submitting a form on a webpage)
- Returns a response containing the requested resource (typically with data like HTML, JSON, JS, etc.)

More specifics about what an HTTP server does:

- Opens a TCP socket on a port (usually port 80 for HTTP)
- Waits for a client (browser) to connect and send a request
- Parses the request to get all of the information out of it and understand what the client wants
- Fetches/generates the response (could just be a static HTML file from a disk)
- Puts the response into HTTP response form and sends it back (sending it back with a status code, the content type, and the content)

- Functions like listen and bind use system calls under the hood
